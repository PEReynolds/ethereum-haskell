etherium-haskell
===

An independent and unaffiliated reimplementation of Etherium in Haskell.

This is still in the early stages; many parts of the protocol are
unimplemented, and there is very little documentation. However, the RLP
encoding / decoding (including automatic deriving for datastructures) and an
in-memory Patricia tree are both functional and well-tested.
